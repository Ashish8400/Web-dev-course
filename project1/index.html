                <h2> Sahid-e-Azam </h2>
                <p><b>Bhagat Singh</b> (1907–1931) was a revolutionary hero of the Indian independence movement. Born in
                    Punjab, he was inspired by his family’s patriotic history and the struggles of his countrymen.
                    Bhagat Singh played a major role in challenging British colonial rule through his bold actions and
                    socialist ideals.

                    At a young age, he became part of revolutionary organizations like the Hindustan Socialist
                    Republican Association (HSRA) and gained fame for his fearless acts, such as the assassination of a
                    British officer in response to police brutality and his symbolic protest of throwing non-lethal
                    bombs in the Central Assembly.

                    His ideas went beyond mere rebellion—he sought to inspire the youth of India toward complete freedom
                    from all forms of oppression. Despite being executed at just 23 years old, Bhagat Singh’s vision of
                    independence, equality, and social justice continues to inspire generations. His undying spirit and
                    sacrifice made him a martyr of the nation, and he is remembered as a symbol of courage and
                    revolution.</p>

                <h3>Role in the Indian Freedom Struggle</h3>
                <p>Bhagat Singh was a revolutionary leader who played a crucial role in India’s independence movement by
                    advocating for armed resistance against British rule. His bold actions and ideas were a departure
                    from the non-violent approach led by many leaders of the time. He believed that true independence
                    meant not just freedom from British rule, but also the creation of a society based on justice,
                    equality, and socialism.<br>
                    <b>Major Contributions:</b>
                    <b> 1.</b> Lahore Conspiracy Case (1928): Bhagat Singh, along with Rajguru and Sukhdev, avenged the
                    death of Lala Lajpat Rai by killing British officer J.P. Saunders.
                    <br>
                    <b>2. </b>Assembly Bombing (1929): He and Batukeshwar Dutt threw non-lethal bombs in the Central
                    Assembly to protest oppressive laws, using the trial to spread their revolutionary ideas.<br>
                    Bhagat Singh’s bravery and revolutionary spirit made him a symbol of courage and an inspiration for
                    future generations in the fight for independence.
